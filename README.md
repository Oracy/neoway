## Requirements to be covered

- [X] Use the https://www2.correios.com.br/sistemas/buscacep/buscaFaixaCep.cfm URL;
- [X] Get data from at least two UFs. The more, the better;
- [X] Collect all records for each UF;
- [X] Each record must contain at least 3 fields: "localidade", "faixa de cep" and a generated "id". Do not let duplicate records in your output file;
  - There are some "duplicated" but only on "localidade" because some "faixa de cep" are different between them, e.g.:
    - {"Id": "3265a9b5-1a70-4b33-a085-70b3258a5e39", "Localidade": "Rio Branco", "Faixa de CEP": " 69900-001 a 69924-999"}
    - {"Id": "7776d6cc-66e4-4c17-9530-723546e4b035", "Localidade": "Rio Branco", "Faixa de CEP": " 69900-001 a 69923-999"}
  - This kind of "duplicated" is because field that was not gathered "tipo de faixa" are different between then, the first one is "Total do munic√≠pio" the second one is "Exclusiva da sede urbana"
  - I just kept it because they have a little difference between them, but in a production environment we need to choose if is ok left like that, or we need one more field to differentiate between them, or just left "Total do munic√≠pio".
- [X] The output format must be JSONL

## Deliverable to be covered

- [X] The code should be sent through github with at least a README documentation explaining how to test and run it.
- [X] It would be REALLY nice if it was hosted in a git repo of your own. You can create a new empty project, create a branch and Pull Request it to the new master branch you have just created. Provide the PR URL for us so we can discuss the code üòÅ. BUT if you'd rather, just compress this directory and send it back to us.
  - Project will be at this [link](https://github.com/Oracy/neoway)
- [X] Do not start a Pull Request to this project.

## Pay Attention points

- [X] There is no right answer, we will evaluate how you solve problems and what are the results achieved.
- [X] We work mainly with Python 3 and Go, but feel free to use any language you feel more comfortable with.
  - I used python 3
- [ ] Unit tests are cool.
- [X] It's important we can execute your project, so make it clear which steps we need to follow to test and execute your project.
